# Contributin to Bakit

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Bakit.
This repository uses a changelog driven release workflow.
Please read this guide before opening a pull request or issue. It will save time for both you and CI.

## How release works (important)

- Changes are declared using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
- Publishing tagging and GitHub releases are fully automated after a pull request is merged
- Contributors never publish packages manually
- Contributors must not bump package.json versions or edit CHANGELOG.md files directly

## Repository structure

Bakit uses monorepo pattern with [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces):

```
├── packages
│   ├── core
│   │   ├── dist
│   │   └── src
│   ├── gateway
│   │   ├── dist
│   │   └── src
│   ├── rest
│   │   ├── dist
│   │   └── src
│   ├── service
│   │   ├── dist
│   │   └── src
│   ├── utils
│   │   ├── dist
│   │   └── src
│   └── ... (other packages)
...
```

Each package contains its own package.json and a CHANGELOG.md file generated by Changesets.

## Making changes

First fork the repository and clone it locally. Work from the main branch.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bakit.git
cd bakit
git checkout main
```

Install dependencies and build all packages.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

You are now ready to make changes.

## When do I need to update changelog

You must add a changeset if your change is user visible, including:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Behavior changes
- Anything that affects public usage

You do not need a changeset for:

- Refactors with no behavior change
- Internal tooling
- Tests
- Documentation only changes (You still need to update `README.md`)

## How to add a changelog entry

Bakit uses Changesets to handle versioning and changelogs.

To add a change description, create a new file in the `.changeset` directory.

For example, we will create `.changeset/add-new-change.md` with the following content:

```
---
@bakit/rest patch
@bakit/service minor
---

Support service system for REST manager
```

After adding a changeset, run the following command locally

```sh
pnpm changeset version
```

This updates versions and generates changelogs automatically.
Do not edit CHANGELOG.md files by hand.
