# Overview

As your bot grows, managing events inline, with `client.on()` or `client.once()`, can become challenging:

- Code becomes cluttered and hard to maintain when everything is in a file.
- Reusing or splitting logic across files is cumbersome.

That's why Bakit provides a **well-structured, modular, and scalable listener system** that solves these problems.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand the main concepts:

- **Listener API** - the interface that allows you to define listeners. It can be accessed with `Listener`.
- **Listener Registry** - the manager that handles registering. It can be accessed with `ListenerRegistry`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="diagram" label="Event Flow">

```
Emitter (e.g, client)
		▼
Listener Registry
		▼
Listener Executor (executing hooks)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This illustrates the lifecycle of an event in Bakit's listener system.

## Benefits

Using Bakit's listener system gives you:

- **Modular code** - each listener in its own file.
- **Scalable architecture** - handle hundreds of events without cluttering `index.ts`.
- **Maintainable structure** - easy to find and modify a specific event listener.
- **Flexible emitter** - can be used with other emitters.

## Typical structure

For loading listeners automatically from files, you may want to use a structure like this:

```
src/
├── index.ts
└── listeners/
	├── MessageCreateListener.ts
	└── ClientReadyListener.ts
```

Then after your client's initialization in your main file, you can use `ListenerRegistry.load()`
with a [glob pattern](https://www.malikbrowne.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-glob-patterns/) that directs to your listener directory. For example:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="code" label="src/index.ts">
	
	```ts
	import { BakitClient, ListenerRegistry } from "bakit";

    const client = new BakitClient({
    	intents: [...],
    });

    await ListenerRegistry.load("src/listeners/**/*.ts");

    await client.login(...);
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

<Admonition type="caution" title="Use a correct path to your source code">
	
If you are running your process using TypeScript compiled source (JavaScript), you must use a path that directs to the compiled source instead. For example:

```ts
await ListenerRegistry.load("dist/listeners/**/*.js");
```

</Admonition>

## Migrating from inline call to Listener API

After setting up a structure for your listeners to stay, you now want to convert your existing inline call listener to Bakit's API.
It's now much simpler because your listener logic stays the same, the only difference is how you config the listener entry.

Here's a minimal setup for `MessageCreateListener.ts`:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="code" label="src/listeners/MessageCreateListener.ts">
	
	```ts
	import { Listener } from "bakit";
	import { Events, type Message } from "discord.js";

	const MessageCreate = Listener(Events.MessageCreate);

	@Listener.use(MessageCreate)
	export default class MessageCreateListener {
		@MessageCreate.main
		public execute(message: Message) {
			// Your logic stays the same here!
		}
	}
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you want to configure your listener to be fired once, you can use an object for more advanced options. Here's an example for `ClientReady` listener:

```ts
const ClientReady = Listener({
	name: Events.ClientReady,
	once: true,
});
```

After the migration, you should be able to delete your old listener safely while the functionalities stay the same!
