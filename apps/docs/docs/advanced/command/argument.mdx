# Argument

Argument system is another special feature in command system. It helps you defining what can users provide for your bot naturally.

## Supported types

For now, argument system supports the following types:

| Type name | Value    | Description                                    |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| string    | `string` | Raw message.                                   |
| number    | `number` | Accept all kind of number.                     |
| integer   | `number` | Accept only integer.                           |
| user      | `User`   | Get user information from user ID and mention. |
| member    | `Member` | Get member information in a guild.             |

## Basic usage

The basic syntax is `Arg.<type>(<name or options>)`.

Here's an example for `avatar` command:

```ts
import { type Context, Command, Arg } from "bakit";
import { type User } from "discord.js";

const Avatar = Command("avatar");

@Command.use(Avatar)
export default class AvatarCommand {
	@Avatar.main
	public async execute(ctx: Context, @Arg.user("user") user: User) {
		await user.send(user.displayAvatarURL({ size: 4096 }));
	}
}
```

Argument is required by default, if you want to make it optional, you can use options object:

```ts
public async execute(
	ctx: Context,
	@Arg.user({ name: "user", required: false }) user: User | null,
) {}
```

If the argument is not provided, it will be passed as `null`.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Use a correct path to your source code">
	
Bakit argument is limited at type validating in code due to decorator's limitation. That means you can either do this without getting any complaint:

```ts
public async execute(
	ctx: Context,
	@Arg.user({ name: "user", required: false }) user: string,
) {}
```

Always double-check the type of your arguments at runtime, especially when working with nullable values.
