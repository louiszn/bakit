# Introduction

Bakit is a is a powerful framework built on top of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org). It provides a clean developer experience while staying lightweight and flexible, especially for commands.

## Why Bakit?

- ðŸ§© **Unified Command System** - write once for both slash and prefix command.
- ðŸš€ **Clean API interfaces** - well-structured commands and events.
- âš¡ **Lightweight** - minimal overhead, only what you need.
- âœ¨ **TypeScript + ESM first** - modern JavaScript tooling out of the box.

Continue to [Installation](/docs/category/installation) to install and run your first bot.

## When is Bakit too much?

- You **don't want to use TypeScript**.
- You don't want to use ESM and **prefer CommonJS**.
- You don't need any fancy scalable APIs for your simple slash command bot.
