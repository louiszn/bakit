# Adding Listeners

After being connected to Discord's Gateway, your client will now receive certain events based from specified intents in client options.

For example, if you requested `MessageContent` and `GuildMessages` intents to Discord, Discord will now send you certain events like:

- `MessageCreate` - for newly created messages from guilds.
- `MessageDelete` - for deleted messages.
- `MessageUpdate` - for edited messages.

See [quick start on configuring intents](/docs/getting-started/quick-start#configuring-intents) for more detailed information.

## Creating your first listener

Here's a minimal example that logs when your bot is ready and prints the content of messages:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="code" label="src/index.ts">
	
	```ts
	import { BakitClient } from "bakit";
	import { Events } from "discord.js";

    const client = new BakitClient({
    	intents: [...],
    });

    // Fires once when the bot is ready
    client.once(Events.ClientReady, () => {
    	console.log("Bot is ready!");
    });

    // Fires every time a message is created
    client.on(Events.MessageCreate, (message) => {
    	console.log(message.content);
    });

    await client.login(...);
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Why are listeners useful?

Listeners allow your bot to react in real time. For example:

- Respond when a user sends a message with certain words.
- Welcome or say goodbye to members joining/leaving a server.
- Update information without polling Discord repeatedly.
