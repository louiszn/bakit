# Quick start

This section will guide you through creating your first bot.
If you're new to [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), don't worry, we will cover all important concepts later!

## Setting up client

Bakit provides its own client class, `BakitClient`, which extends the base [`Client`](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:class) from discord.js.  
This means you get all the usual features of `Client` and Bakit's built-in core systems.

Here's a minimal setup:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="code" label="src/index.ts">
	
	```ts
	import { BakitClient } from "bakit";
	import { GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";

    const client = new BakitClient({
    	intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds],
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Configuring Intents

Discord bots must request Gateway Intents to receive specific events (e.g., messages, reactions, or guild updates).

At minimum, `Guilds` is required for a bot to function, but you may need more depending on your features.

See the [discord.js guide on intents](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html#gateway-intents) for a detailed explanation.

If you plan to use prefix commands or any feature that requires receiving messages in real time, you will also need these intents:

- `MessageContent` - allows your bot to read message content.
- `GuildMessages` - enables receiving messages sent in servers (guilds).
- `DirectMessages` - enables receiving private messages (DMs).

For example:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="code" label="src/index.ts">
	
	```ts
	import { BakitClient } from "bakit";
	import { GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";

    const client = new BakitClient({
    	intents: [
    		GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    		GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
    		GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    	],
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Logging in

Once your client is set up, the final step is to log in using your bot token.
This will establish a connection to Discord's gateway:

```ts
await client.login("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN");
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="Keep your token safe">
	
Never share your bot token publicly or commit it to source control. Store it securely in an environment variable (e.g., `process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN`) or a `.env` file. 
For more details on using `.env` files, see the [dotenv documentation](https://dotenv.org/docs).

## Starting the process

Bakit is a TypeScript-first framework, so TypeScript is required.
You will need a tsconfig.json in your project.

To start your bot, first compile with the TypeScript compiler (tsc), then run the output. For example:

```bash
npx tsc
node dist/index.js
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Tip">

If you prefer skipping manual compilation, you can also use [tsx](https://tsx.is/) to run TypeScript directly:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

</Admonition>

Your bot should now be online and ready to use!
